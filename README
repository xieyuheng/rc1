Dedicated to Manfred von Thun, languages never die

------------

I enrolled in Psychology and Philosophy
because I wanted to know how the human mind works

But rats and stats in Psychology and logic and scientific method in Philosophy
quickly changed my directions

In particular I became interested in the justification of induction
and I wrote my PhD in the field of inductive logic and logical probability
and do deductive logic and programming
